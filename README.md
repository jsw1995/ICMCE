An image encryption algorithm for visually meaningful ciphertext based on adaptive compressed, 2D-IICM hyperchaos and histogram cyclic shift

Run the main function directly
Modify the paths of plaintext and cover to encrypt your own images.

im = cv.imread("date/woman.tif", 0)
cover = cv.imread("date/peppers_gray.tif", 0)

If the code is useful to you, please include a citation in your paper.
